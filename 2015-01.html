<h3>Move Ergs</h3>

<h3>Winter Season for Adults</h3>

<span style="float: right; padding: 10px"><img src='/resources/img/IMG_1485-300.jpg' alt='Grand River' /></span>

<p>Adult rowers have three options for indoor rowing (all GRRA indoor rowing is at Westside Fitness) this winter:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Westside Strong + Rowing Classes</strong> - For access ONLY to all indoor rowing classes + the Westside Strong cardio class (does not include full gym membership), GRRA members can pay a special rate of $30/month. The Westside Strong class is offered in the early morning on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, as well as in the evening on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Rowing classes will be scheduled throughout the week, with the schedule still being finalized - information will be available very soon (and hopefully at the party on Saturday!)</li>

<li><strong>Westside Strong + Rowing Classes + Gym Membership</strong> - For full gym membership including access to the Westside Strong classes and rowing classes, GRRA members can join as members of Westside Fitness for a special rate of $199/year - translating to about $17/month. This is a good deal. To compare, the best promotion available for anyone else at Westside Fitness is a special holiday deal for membership at $50 down and $19.95 a month.</li>

<li><strong>Westside Strong + Rowing Classes + Gym Membership + All Classes</strong> - Finally, for full membership including access to all classes (including intervals, yoga, circuits, pilates, kettlebells, kickboxing etc. as well as the Westside Strong class and rowing classes), GRRA members can join as full gym members at a rate of $320/year - still working out to just over $26/month.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Winter Season for Juniors</h3>
<p>The Junior winter season registration is now open! <a href="event-1833039">Register here</a>.

<p>GRRA has partnered with Westside Fitness for the Junior winter season.  The cost of the season ($225) will include a 1-year membership at Westside Fitness, a weekly cardio class, a weekly yoga class, and two days of erg training each week. This will provide a very well-rounded conditioning program for the juniors.</p>

<p>Payment is due by Saturday, January 17. Payment can be made with online registration via credit card or a personal check may be given to Coach Jason on Wednesday (1/14) or Friday (1/16).
