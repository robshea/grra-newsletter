<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>As we approach Masters Nationals in August, there are tasks for which we still need some help. (Thank you to everyone who stepped up to be a volunteer leader. We will be in touch with all of you within the next month or so).</p>

<h2>Fundraising coordinator</h2>

<p>We are looking for someone to function as a touchstone for people seeking fundraising and donations (basically making sure we aren't approaching the same people/places, identifying sectors of the community we are overlooking, and collecting information and paperwork). More about fundraising below.</p>

<h2>Reception Food</h2>

<p>We will be hosting a reception Friday evening (08/15/14) at Riverside Park. We have a source for live music, but could really use someone who would like to take on the challenge of planning food for an elegant soiree for 300 people on a limited budget.</p>

<h2>Print Program</h2>

<p>A program for the Nationals needs to be created and printed. Any designers/publishers out there?</p>

<h2>Signage</h2>

<p>Some design work and an order for signs needs to be placed (we have the printing source already). Would you like to inform people and tell them where to go?</p>

<h2>Batteries</h2>

<p>We will require 144 batteries for use over the course of Nationals. Would anyone like to organize a battery drive?</p>

<h2>Trailer</h2>

<p>The club will be purchasing a new equipment trailer. Does anyone have any experience with or a good source for procuring a trailer? And would that person be interested in presenting options for purchase to the board?</p>

<h2>Start Tower Scaffolding</h2>

<p>We are having trouble finding a source that can build the scaffolding for the start tower. The big issue seems to be its placement in the water. We have a schematic, if you have a source in mind and would like to sound them out!</p>

<h2>Fundraising</h2>

<p>We still have a sizable amount to raise in sponsorships and donations before we meet our very necessary goal. Without these monies, we simply will not be able to run a successful event and secure the financial (near) future of the club. Attached are brochures that may be used to solicit either sponsors or donors. Please note: while all funds go toward the event, donations go to GRRA 100%, while sponsorships may be split with USRowing. Also, a "Do Not Contact" list is attached; these people/organizations have already been approached by the club.</p>
