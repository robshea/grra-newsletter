<h2>Beer Tent Volunteers Needed</h2>

<p>We still need about 8-10 more volunteers for the Ugly Sweater run on Saturday (11/29). Volunteers should plan to arrive to Calder Plaza by 10:30 AM and should be able to take off by 1:30 PM. It will be a giant pile of fun (and no sticky hands because we'll be selling cans instead of drafts).
