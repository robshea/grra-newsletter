<h2>Regatta Feedback</h2>

<p>We received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the Master Nationals regatta we hosted at Riverside Park in August. Here is some of the feedback.</p>

<p><em>Thanks so much for a wonderful regatta! <b>Great volunteers</b>, beautiful venue, and <b>the event ran like clockwork</b>.</em></p>

<p><em>All the volunteers who played a role in making this regatta happen were fantastically good at organization and friendliness.</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, Beer City USA! I thought this was hype before I went, but they are right. <strong>Best rowing beer garden ever</strong>, located at about the 150m to go mark, with a great view of the course; $5 for potent and tasty craft brews</em></p>

<p><em>We had a fabulous time—great venue, <b>great volunteers, and very well-organized. (I’m an event planner…I know what this takes!)</b></em></p>

<p><em>It was one of the <b>best run</b>, most beautiful regatta <b>I’ve ever competed in my rowing career (which started in 1973.)</b> The officials, volunteers, venue (BEAUTIFUL PARK) and virtually everything was done very well! I’d highly recommend this venue for a future race and appreciated you taking time to read this!</em></p>

<p><em>GR is now <strong>my favorite Masters National venue</strong>, after Oak Ridge of course.</em><br>
- Mike, Oak Ridge</p>

<p><em>I should say, that it was probably the <b>best masters nationals I have ever attended</b>.</em></p>

<p><em>I've been to a lot of Regattas in 30 years and it was one of <b>the best run events I've been to, a credit to you and your volunteer force</b>.</em></p>

<p><em>The regatta <b>far exceeded my expectations</b>. Let's do it here again.</em></p>

<p><em>It was a <b>great regatta, one of the best</b>. And the venue layout was the best as were <b>the many volunteers who kept everything flowing smoothly</b>.</em></p>

<p><em>Riverside Park needs a permanent beer garden.</em></p>

<p><em>Our family lives across from the Riverside Park and thoroughly enjoyed the whole event. We would walk to the races and the "boat village" as we called it two or three times each day. The entire competition from set up to take down appeared to run perfectly. <strong>Everything was so organized and every volunteer and worker knew their role and did it with politeness and amazing effort. We particularly appreciated the volunteers at the entrances to the park and their friendly greetings as we would head over to see all of the action.</strong> Our kids were impressed with the boats and we were amazed at the distances that many traveled for this competition. <strong>It was a highlight of our summer and a fabulous opportunity for our community to see such a well run sporting event.</strong> Thank you to the organizers, staff, volunteers and athletes for the always respectful and polite atmosphere they provided to our family and neighborhood. It was a bittersweet evening tonight as we walked over to wave good bye to the boats. Thank you for such a great spectator experience!</em></p>
