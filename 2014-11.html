<h3>The Leelanau Chase</h3>
<p>This regatta featured the best weather we've had at The Chase in 3 years! Our Women's Masters 8+, Women's Masters 4+ and Womens Masters 1x (Julie Bennett) all took first place in their events! The Men's Masters 4+ and Mixed Masters 4+ both took second place. Our Mixed Junior 8+ also took second. The Mixed Junior Novice 8+ missed third place by only 4 seconds.

<h2>GR Forward - Grand River Plan</h2>
<p>There's a downtown planning process happening right now. A significant part of the plan is an in-depth study of the Grand River corridor. GRRA has a seat on the steering committee. An open house for public participation is being held between 3 and 7 pm every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from now until November 21. Participation in this study is <b>THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY</b> for GR Rowing members to advocate for our sport and its future on the section of the Grand River that we currently use. Public participation processes like this one ("GR Forward") are an excellent opportunity to have a say in future development. Heavy involvement and participation by our members will have a significant impact on the outcome of the plan and subsequent development. (I was a city planner in GR for nearly 7 years and am speaking from experience).</p>

<p>Please plan to stop by at least once between <b>3 and 7 pm every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from now until November 21</b>. This is your chance to make rowing a key part of the Grand River plan!</p>
